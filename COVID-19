COVID-19


COVID 19 is an infectious disease which started from wuhan city. Wuhan is located in China.
COVID 19 spread across the world. Due to this many people have lost their lives. Many peoples are already infected from the disease. A large group of people like migrants lost their savings during the lockdown and they are left no food. Even today  we don’t have medication for this pandemic.


Lockdown 

During the lockdown ,This pandemic have made us to rethink the way we live and way we study.
Even we are now more careful by wearing mask and washing hand frequently.
Teachers are trying their best to teach students. Local business are coming more online. People are now ordering more online food items ever than before.

Schools

During this lockdown period schools , colleges and institutes are remain closed. Digital access is now like oxygen.
Unavailability  of text-books pushed the publishers to bring more ebooks. Which allows students to study while  highlight text, unhighlight text, zoom in and zoom outing the ebook. Now their is Massive open online course are available  in which student can enrol and learn at different pace.


Technology 

Even A.I is helping in grouping of containment zones/ Red zones. Information is shared at a fast pace. So, we can minimise the COVID patients.
As we know “prevention  is better than cure”. We need to develop an early warning system from the technology like A.I, Weather forecast and e.t.c. Which will allow us to control the pandemic and climate change in future or minimise the affect of it. So , we don't  have to suffer as we suffer this year or so.


Healthcare 

Even we have to increase the surge facility extensively in the healthcare. So ,we can treat more people during next pandemic whenever it will happen. And even enhancing the medical system.
So, we can make the vaccine as soon as possible with collaboration with world and reach every corner of the world.


CONCLUSION

I would like to conclude this whenever this kind of pandemic or disaster occur. We have to be Ready by taking steps today that will make better tomorrow. Few steps are Early warning system,
Surge in medical facility and making upgrade in our current education system. so, learning should not be stopped.
At last I would like ask a simple question.
